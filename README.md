# Dynamic Workspaces

A kwin script that creates and deletes desktops as you move windows on the last one.

I intented to replicate some of gnome-desktop's behavior with moving windows around.
As this is a simple script for satisfying my needs,
it only workds horizontally left-toright.
What I did is this:

- There is always an empty desktop on the right
- When you move a window to that desktop, a new desktop is created
- When you move window away from last desktop, or close the window,
  the desktop is destroyed

Version 3.1.0 tested on Plasma versions 6.x.
For versions tested since 5.6, see releases `1.*`, latest found
[here](https://github.com/d86leader/dynamic_workspaces/releases/tag/v1.0.1)

## Installation

On plasma 6:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/d86leader/dynamic_workspaces.git
cd dynamic_workspaces
kpackagetool6 --type KWin/Script --install .
```

On plasma 5, instead of the last line:

```sh
plasmapkg2 --type kwinscript -i .
```

Then you might need to restart kwin. Do this by either logging out and back in, or by running `kwin_x11 --replace` in krunner.

### Upgrade

If updating, change the `plasmapkg2`/`kpackagetool6` command above to the following:

``` bash
# plasma 6
kpackagetool6 --type KWin/Script --upgrade .
# plasma 5
plasmapkg2 --type kwinscript -u .
```

## Known issues

This script doesn't live well with other scripts that create workspaces.
Mix at your own risk!
